Couchbase backend for Django

The current approach focuses on creating a backend for couchbase when developing on django.

The main idea is to follow the https://github.com/django/django pattern and is also inspired from another cool project i like to use, https://github.com/scholrly/neo4django.

It will provide at least an auth and admin interface as well as (obviously) the db package.
